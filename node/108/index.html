<p>I wanted to say hello to the descendant's of James Troy. I recently travelled to Ireland to trace my family roots. My family and I stood at the gates of the Whitechurch Chapel overlooking the Coolahest area where my Grandfather, John Joseph was born. On returning home I attempted to contact the local Catholic Church in Arglish and stumbled onto this website. Of course to my surprise I found what I was looking for right in my own backyard. </p>
<p>We live the next town over from where the Troy family reunion was held in Sept. 2005. </p>
<p>I have contacted many of my aunts, uncles and cousins  and they are excited with this discovery. I will be posting more information as soon as possible.</p>
